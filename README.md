# Requirements
**Packages required**: pygame
```bash
pip install pygame
```


# How to use
1. Run **[main.py](main.py)**.
2. When prompted in the terminal, **input the number of rows and columns** for the maze (the minimum size is 5x5).
3. A window will pop up displaying the generated maze.
4. **Press the spacebar** to start the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm visualization.
5. The DFS algorithm will be visualized in real-time as it explores the maze.
6. After the algorithm completes, **the solution path will be highlighted** in the maze, and in the terminal, you'll see:
    - The **length** of the correct path.
    - The **sequence of steps** the algorithm took to find the correct path.
